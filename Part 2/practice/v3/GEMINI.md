## Objective

The objective of the game is to defeat the fleet of aliens that appears on the screen.
Press 'Play' to begin the game.
The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen, with the ability to move left and right and shoot bullets.
Eliminating all aliens on the screen advances the game to the next level.
Higher levels correspond to increased speed.
If an alien reaches the ship or the bottom of the screen, the round is lost.
The player has 4 ships in total. The game ends when all ships have been used.

## UI Design

The game window will launch in full-screen mode with a light grey background.
The window caption will be 'Alien Invasion Pygame'.
A 'Play' button will appear in the center of the screen when the game is inactive.
The player's ship starts at the bottom center of the screen.
The alien fleet begins at the top left, moving right initially. It drops down and reverses direction upon reaching the screen edges.
The initial vertical distance between the bottom of the alien fleet and the top of the ship will be half the screen's height.
The scoreboard displays:
* Current score: Top center.
* High score: Top right.
* Current level: Top right, above the high score.
* Ships remaining: Top left.

## Object Design

According to the Objective and UI Design, the key objects consist of:
* Game window
* Ship
* Bullet
* Alien
* Alien fleet
* Button
* Scoreboard:
    - Current score
    - High score
    - Current level
    - Ships remaining
* Player

### Game window

The game window is the primary display surface generated by Pygame.
It renders all game objects and text against a background color of (235, 235, 235).
The window operates in full-screen mode.
Upon launch, the 'Play' button is centered in the window.
Pressing 'q' closes the window and exits the application.

### Ship

The ship is the player-controlled entity, displayed as an image at the bottom center of the screen.
It moves horizontally along the bottom edge, constrained by the window's boundaries.
The ship's speed is determined by the current game level.
Pressing the spacebar triggers the ship to fire a bullet.

### Bullet

A bullet is rendered as a small, dark grey rectangle.
When fired, it originates from the ship's current position and travels vertically upwards.
Bullets are removed upon collision with an alien or when they reach the top of the screen.
The bullet's speed is determined by the current game level.
The player is limited to a maximum of 3 active bullets on the screen at any time.

### Alien/Alien fleet

An alien is a computer-controlled entity, rendered as an image.
Aliens are organized into a fleet that starts at the top-left of the screen.
The fleet moves horizontally, drops down when reaching a screen edge, and reverses direction.
This pattern repeats, bringing the aliens closer to the ship.
If an alien collides with the ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the round is lost.
Alien speed increases with each game level.

### Button

The 'Play' button is a UI element centered on the screen, rendered as a filled rectangle with a text overlay.
It displays the text "Play" in white against a green background.
The button includes a hover effect, changing its color when the mouse cursor is positioned over it to indicate it is clickable.
Clicking the button initiates the game loop and hides the mouse cursor. The button becomes invisible during gameplay and reappears when the game ends.

### Scoreboard:

The scoreboard manages and displays statistical information:
* **Current Score** : Displayed in the top right corner. It updates as aliens are hit.
* **High Score** : Displayed in the top center. It tracks the highest score achieved in the current session.
* **Current Level** : Displayed in the top right corner, directly below the current score. It increments when a fleet is cleared.
* **Ships Remaining** : Displayed as a group of ship images in the top left corner. It represents the number of lives remaining.
